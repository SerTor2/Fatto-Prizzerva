[NAMESPACE] 	Tasks

[BUGS]
- A task can NOT be assigned on more than one task (as simple task and as part of a complex task)
- The setup function on the task manager should be recursive to take in consideration the infinite levels of each task
IF YOU DONT WANT TO MAKE IT RECURSIVE YOU COULD USE A BLACKBOARD FOR THE TASKS DATA TO MAKE THEM ACCES IT ON THE SETUP
